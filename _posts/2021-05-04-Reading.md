영어 글 읽기에 익숙하지 않아 영어로 된 자료를 읽는데에 어려움을 많이 겪었던 것 같다. (번역기 돌리면서 해석하다 대부분 시간을 써버렸던 경험이 많았다. ㅠㅠ)

그래서 영어 글 읽기 실력을 향상시키는 것을 목적으로 포스팅을 해보려고 한다.

#### 프로이드

오늘은 **프로이드**가 현대 도시에서의 바라본 고대 로마의 삶에 관한 글이다.

우선, 프로이드의 정신분석이론 중 원초아, 초자아, 자아에 대해 짧게 알아보자.

- 원초아
  : 원초아는 인간의 생물학적 토대에 기초하고 있으며, 모든 욕구의 에너지 근원으로 작용한다. 식욕, 성욕, 공격적 욕구 등이 원초아에서 나온다고 이해하면 될 것 같다.
- 초자아
  : 원초아와 대조되는 개념으로 우리가 추구하는 사회의 도덕이나 윤리 규범을 의미한다. 초자아는 현실적인 조건들과 효율적으로 타협하고 조절하는 것보다는 절대 기준을 가진 도덕성에 더 비중을 둔다.
- 자아
  : 자아는 원초아의 쾌락추구, 초자아의 완벽추구와는 달리 현실을 추구하게 된다. 즉, 자아의 기능은 초자아의 요구에 맞추어 원초아를 만족시키거나 표현하려고 하는 것이다.

세가지 영역은 각기 다른 기능을 하면서 서로 상호작용을 하며 자아에 의해 통합되어 하나의 성격을 형성하고 있다.

Rome: ancient life in a modern city
`로마: 현대 도시에서의 고대 삶`

Sigmund Freud once compared the human mind to the city of Rome.
`프로이드는 한 때 인간 정신과 로마의 도시를 비교했다.`

He was talking about its *intriguing* layers.
(*intrigue*: 강한 흥미를 불러일으키다. )
`그는 도시의 흥미로운 층에 대해 이야기 했었다.`

Just as the mind has a build-up of memories, Rome has a history that goes deeper and deeper:
`정신이 기억층을 가지고 있는 거 처럼, 로마도 더욱 더 깊은 역사를 가지고 있다.`

every modern building is on top of a renaissance one, and under that you find the medieval buildings, and then ancient Rome itself.
`모든 현대식 건물은 르네상스식 건물위에 있다. 그리고 아래에서 너는 중세식 건물과 고대 로마 건물을 발견한다.`

Freud might also have said that - just as with the mind - as you go deeper into the city you find the unpleasant parts like the slums as well as clean, splendidly 'proper' parts.
`프로이드는 아마 말했을 것이다. 정신처럼 너가 도시 깊이 들어감에 따라 너는 빈민가와 같은 불쾌한 부분 뿐만아니라 깨끗하고 화려한 적당한 부분을 발견했을 것이다 라고`

Ancient Rome was home to a million people and was, in its time, the bigger city in Europe.

Most of that million, from the dockworkers to the hairdressers, didn't live in spacious marble villas.

They were packed into tower blocks that lined narrow streets, with hardly any public services.

It must have been a tough place to survive in.

So where can you still find signs of these ordinary 'high-rise Romans'?

Amazingly, the answer is 'all over the city'.

You only need to know where to look, and keep your eyes open.

My favorite remnant of ordinary ancient Roman life is still standing in the heart of tourist Rome.

It's part of a tower block, still surviving to five storeys in a modern square - just underneath the victor Emmanuel monument.

Most of these blocks have fallen down, but this one was lucky:

it survived because it was turned into a church.

It's easy to work out the basic organisation of the block.

At street level, there are shops and workshops.

The principle was 'the higher you went, the worse it got'.

On the first floor you can see some spacious family flats; and above that, bedsits.

The question is, how many people were squashed into these rooms?

If they were for one person, them this was very "tight living".

But if they were single rooms without bathroom or cooking facilities, designed for whole families, they must have been really dreadful conditions.

And in ancient Rome - as this particular high-rise block reminds us - rich and poor lived and worked side by side.

There weren't many zones given over exclusively either to the rich or the poor.

In fact, if you look hard enough, you can find traces of ordinary people inside the most luxurious and ceremonial buildings of the city.

A visit to the ancient Roman Forum can be a disappointment.

This was once the centre of Roman public life, where the senate met.

It is now a rather mysterious set of ruins, with just a few standing landmarks: tow splendid triumphal arches and the three vast columns of the Temple of Castor.

The Forum becomes far more interesting if you also look down for the evidence of the ordinary men and women who shared this space with the great and the good - and who had their own things to do there, from a bit of gambling to basic dentistry.

Running along its south side are the now decidedly unimpressive ruins of what was once the splendid Basilica Julia, home of one of Rome's law courts, plus some government offices.

Not much survives beyond the floor and the steps leading up to it.

A barrier now prevents visitors from walking inside;

but actually you don't need to.

Look over the barrier on the steps, and you will see the clear traces cut into the stone of scores of 'gaming boards'.

We haven't a clue about the exact rules of the games, but never mind.

It's clear that the Basilica Julia wasn't just a place for busy lawyers;

go back 2,000 years and you would find the place littered with men with time on their hands,

betting on some ancient equivalent of backgammon.
