## 영어의 문장 구조(3가지)
: 일단 영어 문장 구조는 단문, 중문, 복문으로 구분할 수 있습니다.
복문은 단문, 중문과 다르게 어떤 문장구조를 택하느냐에 따라 다양하게 문장이 구성될 수 있다.

1. S+V (Simple Sentence): 단문
2. S+V = S+V (Compound Sentence): 중문
    - 대등 접속사(FANBOYS)를 사용하는 경우 - For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So
3. S+V != S+V (Complex Sentence): 복문
    - subordinate conjunction(종속 접속사)
    - adverbs
    - 전치사 구
    - etc.
